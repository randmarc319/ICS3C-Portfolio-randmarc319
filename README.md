# ICS3C-Portfolio-randmarc319
My name is Gavin Randell, I am 17 years old, and the reason I got into computer science is because my whole life ive always had an interest in computers and programming. I always wanted to explore deeper into the work that goes into the technology we have today rather than just looking at the surface. Although computer programming is a very complex subject to get into and can be very daunting at times, i enjoy the challenge of going through the experimenting with code and trying to be creative and find ways to accomplish a certain task. The feeling of getting your code to run successfully makes the work worth it in the end. Before getting into this computer science class i had no prior experience and was basically going in blind, but I was too curious to pass up the opportunity. With the progress I've made I feel that I made the right choice, although it's not much its still satisfying.
